# Base64-to-image
Here we are going to convert base64 string to image. image can be created in the formats like jpg, jpeg, png.
for this process one module is required and that is ‘fs’ which is basically a node module. If it is already in your module then it’s ok and if not then just install this module by typing this command on your terminal-
npm install fs
